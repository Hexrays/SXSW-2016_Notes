(and that's why MicroSoft products suck)

Make the mundane memorable

Surprise

Create an experience that focuses on parts of the brain that delight

Transcend a mundane life **bold assumption**

Two most important factors
* reassurance
* safety
*if you're not in that mode you'll never be happy*

Parents tap into inner child (safe, reassured)
Put down guard, sense that magic does exist

Soulcycle
fitness can be a joyful experience
community, experience, fun, tribal, not a chore, workout that doesn't feel like work

Safety- core philosophy of Disney
Control the environment
work on a subconscious level
**interesting:** A water fountain makes you not worry about being dehydrated

Happiness is not in the moment
Anticipation and Memory are far greater for releasing Dopamine

Experience itself is really important but the most important part is the memory
not an average of the experience but the peak

Memory leads to happiness *in many cases you get the facts wrong*

**Leaving Disneyland** if that is not a good experience it flavors the whole day.

> "The most important parts of the song are the beginning and the end."
- Pete Townsend

Soulcycle class ending/beginning are about bumping into people and creating a community. Purposefully

Portals - entrance to Disneyland

Disney- "even the stores don't compete with each other"

Example:
Checking into a hotel is a mundane experience. A hotel in Chicago has an array of fancy pens to choose from to sign in. In line people start to discuss which pen they're going to choose.

Materials thought through

When you touch something that's really brass and see something fake and out of reach, like a chandelier, you assume it's real

Relationship matters

Surprise and delight, dream weaver, walk away with a memory

Contrast- once it becomes the norm it no longer stands out

no other place where you are going to have that experience

being present in the moment and linking it to another positive experience (forms a stronger memory)

Does happiness belong in all situations

Re-wire memory

Religious groups are losing ground to fitness

DMV needs hospitality training. Shuffling from line to line, why can't it all be done in one line? line experience

> Waiting is only dissatisfying if you're not being entertained.

In terms of digital
* Anticipation
* post experience
* Uber/Lyft
    * not having to pay at the end of the ride
    * removes the uncomfortable transaction part

**Happy engaged employees = happy engaged customers**
