### Embrace what's coming because it's the best way to steer it.

Large momentums (Big trends/Long Term)

Book- [The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future](http://amzn.to/1Mm4mwE)

He's discussing 3 of the 12

### 1) AI Cognify

There is a lot of baggage with the term artificial intelligence.

Convergence of technological factors- GPUs, Big Data, Neural networks

Scale is very important- Billions rather than thousands

Gaming processor demands (speed and quality) made it more accessible for AI

Must be creative and narrow

Google taught an AI "how to learn" to play video games

Narrow but useful

Artificial smartness

Super navigator/ search, Boring, No one is going to fall in love with Google search (Her movie reference, again)

Used for Utility- not human like

virtue of self driving cars is that they don't have human consciousness

we will populate the world with as many different kinds as possible

Think Different

IQ as a service

AI will flow like electricity- from a grid- from a source (Watson), a commodity

The next 10,000 startups = take x add AI or take AI, add x

Having AI won't be special, it's how its used

Smartness you can scale, the more it's used the more it learns and the more useful it is

More companies will be using specialized versions

Network effect

AI will be used to improve AI (uh- isn't that how you get skynet?)

Humanoid robots are very far off. not in the next couple decades.

Industrial helpers- people work next to them

trial and error- learning and reward system

Robots will take over productivity jobs.

Robots will make new jobs

AIs think different. learning how to work with AIs will be the new skill that people want to have

The new economy of jobs for humans will be where productivity is not important

Science, Innovation is not an efficient process. Jobs for humans

Pay for experiences

People who specialize in inefficient aspects of our lives

### 2) Virtuality

In 1989 he thought vr would be everywhere in 5 years

now it's better. but not 1000 x better

Again, commodity pricing- screens, tracking, gyroscopes, processors

But still needs to get cheaper

Now it's real and here to stay

2 kinds, Immersive / presence (mixed/ augmented reality) (may not look real but presence feels real)

Your office will have one screen, your glasses

Internet of **experiences**- conversation, something to interact with, share create sell experiences

Not first person- You Person

A lot of gorey shit from first person shooters is too much to handle in vr. It's happening somewhere much deeper in you head

Tracking is hard (fooling the brain)

Tactile is > 50%

Redirected walking

finding out how to do camera style tricks

series of images, no movement, all happens in your brain

telepresence- eye contact

VR will become the most social of social media

### 3) Tracking

If it doesn't happen in real life, anything that can be tracked will be tracked.

Quantified self

VR your entire behavior will be tracked

Tracking to give you an abundance of medical stuff- personalized medicine / dosage

Anything that can be measured will be measured

[coveillance](http://www.wfs.org/futurist/may-june-2012-vol-46-no-3/tomorrow-brief/wordbuzz-coveillance)- Know who is tracking you and get direct benefit. symmetry of tracking.

private | transparent
generic | personal

**vanity trumps privacy**


### The Future

It will be difficult to believe

Believe in the impossible more often

You have to invent the future.

based on creativity

Singularity > AI makes an AI smarter than itself (repeat)
