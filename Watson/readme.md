Deep Blue- first computer to beat a world champion- 1997 (chess)

Brute force- chips made specifically for chess with enough processing power to look far enough ahead to know what to do

Jeopardy 2011, started working on it in 2007. Very hard human game. spans the entirety of human knowledge. Couldn't use the internet. Just regular text. knowing everything about everything

Confidence measurement-

understanding - reasoning - learning

reads 800 million pages of text in 1 second

moves from programming computers to exposing them to information. Reads and develops theories

Unsupervised vs supervised learning

first version of Watson unsupervised learning thought Dogs were people (because of people referring to them as their children)

things are true in one area and not others

if it's going to interact with people it needs to understand empath and humor

### Watson's potential
Health care, cancer, timely accurate evidence based decisions

Developer Cloud

Network effect: the more people using a platform the more useful it becomes
