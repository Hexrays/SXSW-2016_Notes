The Hubble has [reached it's limit](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/the-limit-of-what-hubble-can-see-f7491e2bcfd7#.79eyet2rl).

Almost every star has planets

There are 4 planets with oceans in our solar system

is there another earth?

The universe was formed 13.8 Billion years ago. Evenly distributed. Mostly Dark matter.

Key Goals: To findo out more about the universe.

** Start with a description of the Hubble, it's goals, it's limitations **

lightwaves expand as they travel and get redder.

Designed to detect and study the first generation of galaxies in the universe.

Insane

The prescription of the mirrors

the hubble orbits the earth
JWST will [orbit](http://jwst.nasa.gov/orbit.html) the sun approx 1 million miles from earth

Can look back to 400 million years after the big bang

See things never seen before
