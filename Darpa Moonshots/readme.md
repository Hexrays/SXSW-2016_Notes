DARPA
Create breakthrough tech
1957 in response to sputnik

Direct neural interfaces with the brain
express intent by thinking about it

[Neuroprosthetics](http://www.bme.miami.edu/nrg/)
Robots moving from signals from the brain

emerging infectious diseases
threat to national security

[vaccine tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD-ex1nrtGI) -> too slow, too late
only prevents 1.6% of cases once distributed

trying to make vaccines in the Human Body
Not gene therapy
the effects are gone after time
10 years down to 30 days for ebola vaccine

next generation neural technology
fully implantable

DARPA: go after the hardest problem you can and enable people to solve it.
Robotics > virtual flight simulator

how should we think about our brains interacting with virtual environments

### Memory

Military people with traumatic brain injury
many different types of memory, declarative - facts
neural interfaces to facilitate memory formation and recall

> "If you're not failing every now and again you're not doing anything innovative."

sending signals back into the brain- sensory information

Holy shit

Neuroscientist and geneticist

neurons communicate through synapses
traverse chemicals form the basics of how memories work

epigenetics- above the DNA, what is turned on and off

enhance protein expression

what does the future hold?
invented by creativity

DARPA employees are only allowed to stay for 2 to 4 years.
