Go (the game) can't be beaten with brute force

Architect solutions for very specific problems

but not broad intelligence that can do many things

in order to be effective it needs to have emotional component/intelligence
* improvise
* respond

### AlphaGo
* Self play (against itself)
* Very targeted, can't play chess
* Early on described as "creative"

Experiments in machine intelligence- [EMI](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/algorithmic-music-david-cope-and-emi/) [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kuY3BrmTfQ)

Creating behavior

### Good Challenges
* machines increasingly interacting with humans
* need to be broad and generalizable
* what kids can do most machines can't
* [winograd schema challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_Schema_Challenge) Successor to the Turing test
* great concrete challenge
* software system that can take a 4th grade level test
* Natural language challenge
* common sense, machines don't have it
* perform a debate, understand a problem and how to influence it

Ex Machina (movie) V2 of the Turing test-
* test of gullibility?
* not a lot of rational benchmarks
* too short to be impressive or useful
* not really a great test

games are a place where we see progress in AI

Paul Allen > Allen Institute

Is the human brain a machine?

AlphaGo is not the equivalent of Landing on the moon

Movie "Her" keeps coming up in AI talks
* AI knew him really well
* high emotional intelligence
* persuasive
* high EQ
* persuade behavioral changes
* build rapport

We are at the very early days of synthetic emotions

Adam Cheyer on "Her": Kept trying to reverse engineer the AI while watching the movie until she(Her) asked "Can I watch you sleep?" Love. Couldn't figure it out. Stopped trying.

Siri- tool to augment people's productivity. speed up

Added in "delight nuggets" to surprise and humanize. Add personality.

[Viv](http://viv.ai/)- harness the world aka wikipedia

Ad supported internet- why should I trust that it's acting in my interest?

Trust Rapport. understanding your data is going to be collected/ how it is used

Collect data -> send to marketer

Net sharing back with the people. We supplied the data

credit card # trade off

Convenience vs privacy/ transparency vs control

Ethical structures:
* "my robot did it" is not an excuse.
* operator still has responsibility
* not skynet

Medical diagnosis system needs empathy and compassion.

Supervised vs unsupervised learning

unsupervised: sense the world, build models

"We're adding 1 + 1 in the field of mathematics"
-Adam Cheyer

* AI -> not a real risk
* Her -> bored with us

(A long way away)

We're so early we're only building the component technologies.

> "Today we're building the technical pieces."

Ethical

"Emotional chip" could be embedded into Iot
* would allow system to be more responsive to the user's needs
* computers have no social skills
* responsive + predictive

Viv - another channel for businesses

conversational interaction

acquiring common sense
* how do you represent common sense to a computer?
* how do we make progress and measure it?

Should we be afraid? As afraid as we are of extra-terrestrials
